# About Me
Hi, my name is Li Quan Soh (you can call me Li or Li Quan). I have some experience with PPI visualization via BioGRID, CD and motif searching via InterProScan, naive DEG analysis via DESeq2, and cis-elements identification via MEME & JASPAR. If you're interested in studying together, shoot me a message.
